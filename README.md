# Shopping Cart

This is a simple e-commerce project built using React, HTML, JavaScript, Sass, and Vite. The project includes a homepage and a shop page with a shopping cart functionality. The application allows users to navigate between the homepage and the shop page using a navigation bar that is displayed on both pages. The shop page displays a list of products with individual card elements for each product. Each card includes an input field for the user to manually specify the quantity of items they want to buy. Additionally, there are increment and decrement buttons for fine-tuning the quantity, a title for the product, and an "Add To Cart" button.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage by clicking on the "Home" link in the navigation bar.
2. Navigate to the shop page by clicking on the "Products" link in the navigation bar or by choosing on of the products in "Featured Products" in Home page.
